/*
When inheritance is used, the following rules are recommended:
1. An abstract base class or trait is subclassed one level by concrete classes, including case classes.
2. Concrete classes are never subclassed, except for two cases:
    a. Classes that mix in other behaviors defined in trait s (see Chapter 9). Ideally, those behaviors should be orthogonal, i.e., not overlapping.
    b. Test-only versions to promote automated unit testing.
3. When subclassing seems like the right approach, consider partitioning behaviors into traits and mix in those traits instead.
4. Never split logical state across parent-child type boundaries.
